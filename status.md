# Alternative working

AC21
A21v1.0 Firmware_V1.0.0.0_multi.zip

This firmware also works,in parts works i.e WIFI and dashboard is working but most of them are not.These was the firmware I had flashing before AC10U firmware,which actually booted up the router,
previous ssid was automatically  started.Looking it gave me time to breath.But lots of things were working and lots of them were not.

Checking online,this was actually a wireless repeater,but that doesnt work.
SO for the time being if other firmware fails,still I have one which can boot up atleast.
